# Modules

Every Sylo feature is a **module** — toggled and configured per server from the
dashboard (`/guilds/<id>/m/<module>`), like MEE6 or Dyno plugins. Modules are
**off by default** unless noted; enable them on the module's page.

Each page below lists what the module does, the permissions it needs, its
settings, and any commands (prefix `!` by default, configurable per server).
