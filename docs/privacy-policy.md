# Privacy Policy — Sylo

**Effective date:** 2 September 2026
**Last updated:** 1 October 2026

This Privacy Policy explains what data the **Sylo-Fluxer** application for Fluxer
(a port of the Discord bot Sylo) and its test instance (the "Bot"), and the Sylo web dashboard (the
"Dashboard"), collect and how it is used. The instances covered by this policy
are operated by **Ferdinand99** (<https://github.com/Ferdinand99>) (the
"Operator"), who is the data controller for them. Sylo is open-source (MIT);
self-hosted instances are run by their own operators — see section 10.

The Operator does **not** sell your data, does **not** show advertising, and does
**not** use third-party analytics or tracking.

## 1. Message content

Sylo **does** read the content of messages in the channels it can see (Fluxer
delivers message text to bots without a separate privileged permission). Several optional modules need to read messages in real time to
function:

- **Auto-moderation** — scans new and edited messages against the filters a
  server enables (links, invites, spam, caps, banned words, …) and acts on a
  match. The message is not stored.
- **Counting** — reads the number posted in the counting channel.
- **Autoresponder** — matches messages against the server's trigger phrases.
- **Starboard** — copies a highly-reacted message into a highlights channel.
- **Server logging** — mirrors message edits/deletions to a log channel.
- **Leveling** — counts that a message was sent (not its text) to award XP.

Sylo does **not** keep a copy of message content, **with one exception:**
**modmail ticket transcripts**. When the Tickets module is enabled, the full
text and attachment links of the conversation between a member and staff are
stored so staff can read the thread from the Dashboard (see section 2).

## 2. Data the Bot stores

Everything is kept in a single local SQLite database. What exists depends on
which modules a server enables.

### Server configuration *(no personal data)*

Mod-log channel, default embed colour, dashboard-admin ("bot master") roles,
per-module settings and per-command permission overrides, saved embed messages
and scheduled/recurring posts you compose, autoresponder trigger/response pairs,
starboard settings, the Twitch logins and YouTube channels a server watches, and
the public-leaderboard vanity slug.

### Moderation & safety records

- **Infractions / case log** — for each moderation action (warn, note, timeout,
  kick, ban, unban): the affected member ID, moderator ID (or "dashboard"), the
  action, a reason, a timestamp and a per-server case number. `!case delete`
  marks a case inactive but keeps the row for audit.
- **Ban appeals** — the banned member's ID and tag, the ban reason, the member's
  free-text answers to the server's appeal questions, and the staff decision and
  reason.
- **Config audit log** — the display name of whoever changed a setting from the
  Dashboard, what changed, and when.

### Member activity

- **Leveling** — per-member XP, level, message count, voice minutes and
  last-active time, plus per-week and per-month XP rows for the periodic
  leaderboards.
- **Invite tracking** — per-member invite tallies and a record of who invited
  each joiner (an attribution graph), plus any personal invite code Sylo minted
  for a member.
- **Counting** — the ID of whoever counted last.
- **AFK** — a member's away status, away message and previous nickname.
- **Birthdays** — the day and month (and optionally year) a member registers.
- **Giveaways** — the host, the entrants, and the drawn winners.
- **Polls** — the poll creator. Votes are Fluxer reactions and are not stored;
  the row is deleted when the poll ends.
- **Temporary voice channels** — the owner of a spawned channel and its
  per-channel ban list. The row is deleted when the channel empties.

### Conversation content

- **Modmail ticket transcripts** — the text and attachment URLs of ticket
  messages, from both the member and staff (see section 1).

### Notifier bookkeeping *(no personal data)*

"Have we already announced this" markers for free-game offers, Twitch / Kick
streams, YouTube videos/livestreams and RSS/social feed items, and the message
IDs of alert and starboard posts.

### Game-stat cache

The game title, player name and platform you look up with `!stats`, and the
statistics returned by the upstream provider, with a timestamp. Entries expire
automatically (default: 5 minutes).

## 3. Data the Dashboard processes

The Dashboard can run with or without login.

- **Open mode (no login):** the Dashboard collects no personal data of its own
  beyond ordinary server request logs (section 5). It sets no cookies.
- **Fluxer login enabled:** when you choose "Log in with Fluxer", the Operator
  receives, via Fluxer OAuth2 (`identify` and `guilds` scopes), your Fluxer
  user ID, username, avatar, and the list of servers you are in together with
  your permission level in each. This is used only to show your name in the
  Dashboard and to check that you administer a given server. It is held in **one
  signed session cookie** in your browser (`httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`), is
  **not** written to the database, and is cleared when you log out or the
  session expires (7 days). No analytics or tracking cookies are used. The
  Fluxer access token obtained during login is used once to read the above and
  is not stored.

## 4. Legal basis for processing

Where the Operator processes personal data of people in the EEA or the UK, it
relies on **legitimate interests** (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR / UK GDPR) as the legal
basis, as set out below. In every case the processing is limited to Fluxer IDs
and feature-specific counters or records; message content is not stored except
for modmail transcripts (section 1).

| Purpose | Legitimate interest relied on |
| --- | --- |
| Running the modules a server enables (leveling, AFK, birthdays, counting, invite tracking, temporary voice channels, giveaways, polls, starboard, server statistics/insights) | Operating the features a server's administrators have turned on and its members choose to use |
| Moderation & safety records (infractions/case log, ban appeals, auto-moderation, config audit log) | The interest of the server and its members in keeping the community safe and keeping an auditable record of moderation decisions |
| Modmail ticket transcripts | Handling, and being able to review, the contact/support requests a member starts |
| Dashboard login (Fluxer OAuth2 identity + guild list) | Authenticating server administrators; taken only when you choose "Log in with Fluxer" |
| Operational logs | Security, abuse prevention and debugging |
| Game-stat cache | Serving `!stats` responses quickly without repeatedly querying the upstream provider |

The Operator has weighed these interests against your rights: only identifiers
and minimal per-feature data are processed, nothing is sold or profiled, you can
get a copy of your data at any time with `!mydata` and erase it with `!forget`
(section 7). You can also **object** to processing based on legitimate interests,
and request **access**, **correction** or **erasure**, by contacting the Operator
(section 9). On an objection or erasure request the data is deleted, except the
minimum a server needs to keep to enforce an active ban or defend a moderation
decision.

Self-hosted instances must determine their own legal basis (section 10).

## 5. Logs

The service writes operational logs (startup messages, errors, and the fact that
a command or dashboard action occurred, which may include Fluxer IDs). These
are used for debugging and abuse prevention and are kept only as long as
operationally useful.

## 6. Third parties

- **Fluxer** — the Bot and Dashboard operate on Fluxer's platform; your use is
  also governed by [Fluxer's Privacy Policy](https://fluxer.app/privacy).
- **Game-stats providers** — when you request player statistics, the player name
  and platform you supply are sent to the relevant public API
  (`api.gametools.network` for Battlefield, Jagex Hiscores for RuneScape) to
  retrieve the stats. Only data you explicitly put in a `!stats` command is sent.
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** — if a server enables captcha verification, the
  verification page loads Turnstile from Cloudflare and sends the challenge
  response to Cloudflare for validation. No account data is shared.
- **Off-site backup destination** — if the Operator has configured off-site
  backups (section 7), the encrypted-in-transit database snapshot is sent to that
  destination (a WebDAV server and/or a webhook), which the Operator
  controls.

No other third parties receive your data.

## 7. Retention and deletion

- **`!mydata`** — any member can run `!mydata` in a server to receive, by direct
  message, a JSON file of everything Sylo has stored about their Fluxer account
  in that server (the same scope as `!forget`, below). Nothing is deleted. Rate
  limited to one export per member per server every few minutes.
- **`!forget`** — any member can run `!forget confirm:True` in a server to delete
  the data Sylo keys to their Fluxer account **in that server**: infractions,
  leveling XP (including period rows), ticket history (including their ticket
  messages), ban appeals, invite records, AFK status, birthday and giveaway
  entries. It does **not** remove messages already posted to channels, a
  completed giveaway's winner list, or the display name recorded in that server's
  config audit log.
- **Admin-assisted erasure** — a server's administrators can look up and delete a
  specific member's data from the Dashboard's **Member data** page (same scope as
  `!forget`). When they do, Sylo sends that member a direct message confirming
  what was removed.
- **Removing the Bot from a server** immediately stops processing and
  **automatically deletes every stored row for that server** (all of section 2).
- **Game-stat cache** entries expire automatically and hold only public game
  data.
- **Ephemeral rows** — ended polls and emptied temporary-voice-channel records —
  are deleted automatically.
- **Session data** lives only in your browser cookie.

For any request the above does not cover, contact the Operator (section 9).

### Retention schedule

| Data | Retained for | Deleted when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server configuration & module settings | As long as the Bot is in the server | Bot removed from the server; or the setting is changed or cleared |
| Infractions / moderation case log | Indefinitely, as a moderation record | `!forget`; admin-assisted erasure; Bot removed. Inactive cases (`!case delete`, expired temp-bans) are kept for audit unless the server sets a "delete inactive cases after N days" limit |
| Ban appeals | Indefinitely | `!forget`; admin-assisted erasure; Bot removed |
| Config audit log | Indefinitely | Bot removed from the server (not covered by `!forget` — it records only a display name) |
| Leveling XP, level, message/voice counters | Until erased | `!forget`; admin-assisted erasure; Bot removed; leaderboard reset by an admin |
| Weekly / monthly leveling period rows | ~10 weeks / ~6 months | Automatic pruning, or any of the leveling triggers above |
| Invite tracking (tallies + attribution graph) | Until erased | `!forget`; admin-assisted erasure; Bot removed |
| AFK status | Until the member returns or is erased | Member sends a message; `!forget`; Bot removed |
| Birthdays | Until removed | Member or admin removes it; `!forget`; Bot removed |
| Giveaway entries | Until the giveaway ends, then until erased | `!forget` (entries only — a finished giveaway's winner list is kept); Bot removed |
| Poll creator record | Until the poll ends | Poll ends (row deleted automatically) |
| Temporary voice channel owner + ban list | Until the channel empties | Channel empties (row deleted automatically); Bot removed |
| Modmail ticket transcripts | Until erased, or the server's "delete closed tickets after N days" limit (off by default) | `!forget`; admin-assisted erasure; Bot removed; a closed ticket ageing past the server's limit |
| Notifier bookkeeping *(no personal data)* | Rolling | Automatic pruning; Bot removed |
| Game-stat cache | 5 minutes (configurable) | TTL expiry |
| Dashboard session | 7 days | Logout or expiry (browser cookie only) |
| Operational logs | As long as operationally useful | Rotated or discarded by the Operator |

**Backups.** The database is snapshotted automatically for recovery; the newest
few snapshots are kept (7 by default) and older ones are overwritten. If the
Operator has enabled off-site backup, a copy of each snapshot is also sent to a
WebDAV server and/or a webhook the Operator controls. A snapshot taken
before an erasure still contains the removed rows until it rotates out.

## 8. Security

Data is stored on the Operator's self-hosted infrastructure. The database file is
not publicly exposed, and automatic snapshots are kept for recovery. The
Dashboard is run behind authentication or on a trusted network. No method of
storage or transmission is completely secure, and the Operator cannot guarantee
absolute security.

## 9. Contact

Privacy questions or requests to access, correct, erase or object to processing
of your data: open an issue at <https://github.com/Ferdinand99/Sylo/issues>, or
contact the Operator privately via their GitHub profile if the request contains
sensitive information. For suspected security vulnerabilities, please use
GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on the repository rather than a public
issue.

## 10. Self-hosted instances

Anyone may run their own copy of Sylo. If you operate a self-hosted instance,
**you** are the data controller for it, you must determine your own legal basis
for the data it stores, and this policy does not apply to your users — publish
your own. Sylo gives you the same tools: `!forget` for per-member erasure and
automatic full deletion of a server's data when the Bot is removed from it.
Consider your own legal obligations for the data your instance stores.

## 11. Changes

This policy may be updated; the "Last updated" date will change and the revised
version will be published at the same URL.

- **4 September 2026** — added a legal-basis section (section 4) and a retention
  schedule (section 7); documented off-site backup retention; refreshed the data
  inventory (case log, voice XP, birthdays, RSS/social notifier markers); added
  the `!mydata` self-service export (section 7); noted the optional per-server
  auto-deletion of old closed tickets and inactive cases.
- **2 September 2026** — corrected the message-content section and expanded the
  data inventory to match the current feature set.
