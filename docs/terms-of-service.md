# Terms of Service — Sylo

**Effective date:** 2 September 2026
**Last updated:** 1 October 2026

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the **Sylo-Fluxer**
application for Fluxer (a port of the Discord bot Sylo) and its test instance (each, and together, the
"Bot"), together with the Sylo web dashboard (the "Dashboard"). The Bot and
Dashboard are operated by **Ferdinand99** (<https://github.com/Ferdinand99>) (the
"Operator"). Sylo is open-source software licensed under the MIT License; anyone
may run their own instance, and these Terms apply to the instances operated by
the Operator.

By adding the Bot to a Fluxer community, using its commands, or accessing the
Dashboard, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Bot or
the Dashboard.

## 1. Eligibility

You must meet Fluxer's minimum age requirement for your country and comply with
the [Fluxer Terms of Service](https://fluxer.app/terms) and
[Community Guidelines](https://fluxer.app/guidelines) at all times.

## 2. What the Bot does

Sylo is a multi-purpose server bot. Its features are organised into modules that
each server's administrators turn on and configure. They include:

- **Moderation** — kick, ban, timeout, purge, slowmode and a warnings log with
  configurable auto-actions, plus a moderation-log channel.
- **Auto-moderation** — real-time message filtering (links, invites, spam, caps,
  banned words, and similar).
- **Engagement** — leveling and XP with rank cards and a public leaderboard,
  reaction roles, welcome/goodbye messages, a welcome channel, starboard,
  counting, polls, giveaways, AFK, and custom commands.
- **Utility** — modmail tickets, ban appeals, invite tracking, autoresponders,
  sticky messages, reminders / scheduled posts, temporary ("join to create")
  voice channels, server-statistics channels, and member verification (optionally
  captcha-gated).
- **Notifications** — Twitch and YouTube live/upload alerts and free-game
  announcements.
- **Game statistics** — on request, Battlefield-series player statistics looked
  up from the third-party public API at `api.gametools.network`.
- **A web dashboard** — an interface for server administrators to enable and
  configure modules and to view the Bot's per-server data.

Not every module is enabled on every server, and features may be added, changed,
or removed between versions (see section 4).

## 3. Acceptable use

You agree not to:

- use the Bot to violate the Fluxer Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or
  any applicable law;
- use moderation features to harass, target, or abuse others;
- attempt to disrupt, overload, reverse-engineer for malicious purposes, or gain
  unauthorised access to the Bot, the Dashboard, or the infrastructure they run
  on;
- automate, scrape, or resell the Bot's responses or the third-party data it
  retrieves in violation of the relevant provider's terms.

Server administrators are responsible for how the Bot is used within their
servers, including which members are granted moderation permissions.

## 4. Availability and changes

The Bot and Dashboard are provided on a best-effort basis. The Operator may
modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the service at any time, with or
without notice, and may add, change, or remove features. Commands,
data structures, and hosted URLs may change between versions.

## 5. Third-party services

The Bot depends on **Fluxer** and, for statistics lookups, on the
**gametools.network** API. Your use of the Bot is also subject to those
providers' terms, and the Operator is not responsible for their availability,
accuracy, or conduct.

## 6. Data

The Bot stores the data its enabled modules need to function — for example
per-server settings, warnings and appeals, leveling and invite records, and
modmail transcripts. What is stored, how long it is kept, and how to delete it
(the `!forget` command, and automatic deletion when the Bot leaves a server) is
described in the [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md), which forms part of these
Terms.

## 7. Disclaimer of warranties

THE BOT AND DASHBOARD ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. The
Operator does not warrant that the Bot will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that
any statistics shown are accurate or current.

## 8. Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE OPERATOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY
LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO your use of, or
inability to use, the Bot or Dashboard — including any moderation action taken
through the Bot. Where liability cannot be excluded, it is limited to the
greatest extent permitted by law.

Moderation actions (kicks, bans, timeouts, message deletions, warnings) are
initiated by server staff, not by the Operator. The Operator is not responsible
for those actions or their consequences.

## 9. Termination

You may stop using the Bot at any time by removing it from your server. The
Operator may remove the Bot from any server or restrict access to the Dashboard
at its discretion, including for breach of these Terms.

## 10. Changes to these Terms

These Terms may be updated from time to time. Material changes will be reflected
by the "Last updated" date above and published at the same URL. Continued use of
the Bot after a change constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

vulnerabilities, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on the repository
rather than a public issue.
